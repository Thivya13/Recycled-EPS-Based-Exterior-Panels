# Recycled-EPS-Based-Exterior-Panels
The project focuses on developing a sustainable solution to address two major issues: waste 
management and building energy efficiency. Expanded Polystyrene (EPS), a widely used material in 
packaging and construction, is often considered non-biodegradable and poses a significant 
environmental problem. By recycling EPS waste into insulation panels, this project aims to turn an 
environmental liability into an eco-friendly resource. The insulation panels made from recycled EPS 
will help reduce indoor temperatures in hot climates, lowering the dependence on energy-intensive 
cooling systems and reducing operational costs and carbon emissions. 


The innovative process developed in this project includes not only the recycling of EPS but also the 
recovery of harmful gases, such as pentane, styrene, and CO₂, during the process. This 
comprehensive system ensures that the recycling process is both environmentally friendly and 
efficient, contributing to a circular economy.
